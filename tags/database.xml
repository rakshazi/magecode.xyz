            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s assume that as developer you are in following situation:
You know a product id and you have to fetch single attribute value of a product which id you already know.
For example let’s try to get color attribute of Magento product.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How would you do it?
Are you going to load the product or you would look for more efficient solutions in order to fetch only the attribute you are looking for?</p>

<p>Magento allows us to fetch product attribute in many ways and depending on the context we could choose one.
I am definitely against loading entire product in case there are much more efficient solutions and the goal is to fetch single product attribute
(not all product attributes).</p>

<p>I think that people choose the easy way because:</p>

<ul>
<li>People read the first answer (which sometimes is not the most efficient) in StackOverflow but don’t check other answers.</li>
<li>There is a lack of Magento documentation.</li>
<li>Missing out of the box way how to accomplish the task.</li>
<li>There are many examples in Internet but they are not descriptive enough to explain what happens on background and how efficient they are.</li>
</ul>

<p>As first example,
I would like to start with one of the efficient ways because I know many people would copy / paste this solution in their project,
stop reading and continue with their daily work.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last few weeks I was fighting with problem that partially broke Magento url indexer.
Basically the url indexer was working but at certain point it was breaking.
At this point I was getting exception and not all url rewrites were written to core_url_rewrite table.
Everyday the problem was getting bigger and bigger because all new products contained “catalog/product/view/id”
(I call those urls – “ugly” urls) but the desired urls suppose to be human readable and end with “.html”.</p>

<p>This issue could be reproduced only on live environment and in order to reproduce it locally
I had to copy all catalog tables (<code>catalog_*</code>) and <code>core_url_rewrite</code> table from live to local environment.</p>

<p>When I run Magento url indexer from command line I got:</p>

<pre><code>php shell/indexer.php --reindex catalog_url
An error occurred while saving the URL rewrite
</code></pre>

<p>In Magento exception log I had:</p>

<pre><code>exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[23000]:
Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'product/2469/361-1-1'
for key 'UNQ_CORE_URL_REWRITE_ID_PATH_IS_SYSTEM_STORE_ID''
</code></pre>
